# Intro_to_Computer_Programming_Project
For Mr. Cozort's Intro to Computer Programming class
# this file was created by Shubhankar Gaur 
# # Sources: goo.gl/2KMivS - thanks Chris Bradfield!
#Also, most of this is Mr. Cozort's code (which I copy-pasted to learn + catch up) 
# but I still gained a fundamental knowledge of the material by changing both gameplay and visual aspects

'''changes: changed background music 
changed clouds 
changed image transparency
changed background color, 
changed player sprite image and animations
added a new powerup that flings you left or right when contacted
changed player jump height to eliminate need for enemy RNG
changed jump sounds
changed powerup icon 
changed platform attribute
made cactus fling you downwards
added "S" key to go downwards to strategically hit enemy, rather than letting go of spacebar for more control'''

''' bugs: 
Sometimes, hitting a powerup while still causes the game to end.
Cactus only spikes you down at certain angles because of how the platform works
Rightpow sometimes causes you to phase through a platform
Powerups cluster up when you die- FIXED!
If S is held as you die while falling down, the game gets stuck in a loop :(
Clouds too big, picture not transparent- FIXED!

'''Journey: At first, my idea was a bit ambitious: I wanted to create a copy of Doodle jump, essentially: https://youtu.be/VCy4UIhkaf4 
However, following along with Mr. Cozort's code, I realized that shooting bullets out of my sprite's face would be a little hard to do with my lack of experience.
With my limited knowledge and the instruction you gave me, I was able to make major modifications to my code with the help of my peers at this table (shoutout Jacob and Jay and maybe Gavin and Ethan!)
Overall, I think it turned out great- the game is super fun to play! Thanks so much for an amazing year.
